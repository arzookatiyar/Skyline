At the lowest level, we only store the nodes(shops of every type).\
---> a small graph, now we only store the shortest distance between every pair, use ASJQ to compute the skylines?
Use the dijkstra's to find all the shops of the 1st type to all the other nodes in this small graph? (Can we not use some other criteria?)






Even for the process of ASJQ we have done the preprocessing. Find the shortest distance to all the nodes in the graph and then store all the relations?!!
Even if we leave the precomputed relations. 
Given the source and the destination we need to find the 1st relation, we need to do dijkstras to find the nearest nodes of type1.
(Plus we are keeping the order of the sequence fixed!!!  From the index structure we may not need to keep the order fixed?!!! (CHECK!))
